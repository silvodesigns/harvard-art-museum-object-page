# Harvard Art Museum: Object Pages
Internship project for the summer of 2018 


<h1>Project Overview</h1>

Harvard Arts Museum's website has over 2,000 items from their collection stored in their databases. Each of these items can be found online 
in the form of object pages. The items objects pages contain important information about the piece being looked at such as images, history,
identification and physical description. All of this information is generated by a template that contains the HTML & CSS markup dictating the
look and behavior of the page.

<h1>Problem</h1>

The problem with the current markup for the object pages is that it is not very semantic or accessible. As a result, the current markup
is not as easy to manage or read from the back end and it is not friendly to assistive technologies such as screen readers.

<h1>Goals</h1>

The goal of this undertaking is to come up with a more contemporary, semantic and responsive oriented approach to marking up the layout 
of the object page while making it easy to manage from the back end and friendly to assistive technology.
